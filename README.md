# did-vc-iot-iam

Prototype mono repo for a DID and Verifiable Credential based IAM system using Hyperledger Fabric.

## Components

- `fabric/`: placeholder Fabric network scripts and Go chaincode.
- `issuer-service/`: FastAPI service that issues VCs (placeholder).
- `verifier-service/`: FastAPI service that verifies VCs (placeholder).
- `device-simulator/`: Python device simulator (placeholder).

## Notes

This repo contains minimal starter code and simple health checks. It avoids advanced features like DIDComm, wallets, or zero knowledge proofs.

## Automated Testing

Generate issuer keys and create `.env.dev`:

python scripts/gen_issuer_keys.py

Start services:

docker compose up --build

Run integration tests:

python scripts/integration_test.py

## Performance emulation

This simulates constrained CPU and memory at the application layer. It does not model microcontroller firmware, radio behavior, or physical hardware.

Run a local performance pass:

python scripts/gen_issuer_keys.py
docker compose up --build
python scripts/run_perf.py

Run constrained profiles:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.perf.yml --profile lite up --build

Outputs are written to the `perf-out` folder. Optional per-iteration delay is controlled by `SLEEP_MS`.

## Device agent demo mode

Run the demo walkthrough inside the device agent container:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.perf.yml --profile moderate up --build

Demo environment variables:

MODE=demo SHOW_JSON=1 PAUSE=1 PERF_RUNS=200
